# TootSharp

## Motivation

This is a TUI (Terminal User Interface) client for interactive with Mastodon, likely similar to the [one I created for Tumblr](https://github.com/jfabry-noc/GoTumble) but hopefully a bit more useful since content on Mastodon is primarly text-based.

## Goals

### Definite Goals

- Posting new text-based content.
- Viewing home, local, and federated timelines with caching.
- Favoriting boosting, and replying to content from said timelines.
- Viewing notifications.

### Potential Goals

- Supporting image uploads.
- Following/unfollowing accounts.
- Updating profile information.

## Project State

Insanely early.
